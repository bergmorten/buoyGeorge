    <p>This is where you view and manage your organization fleets.</p>
    <p>
        You may filter by name, or simply find what you are looking for in the
        list. If the list is empty, you may create a new fleet by clicking "New
        fleet". From the list you may assign users and vehicles to your fleet,
        and assign you fleet to a project by clicking the corresponding buttons.
